# LudiPhys
A physics sandbox game made by LudicrousFun and inspired by Universe Sandbox 2

Game uses particles to simulate planets.

planets are a collection of particles bound together by gravity.

particles exert forces like gravity, collision, friction and 'pressure' forces.

particles have properties and thermodynamics.


# Theory

This game uses an implicit SPH implementation where particles simply apply radial forces to simulate effects. This is good as it only relies on purely emergent behaviour and does not need to be explicitly told what to do, this makes the simulation extremely easy to modify and to create. Pressure and Gravity forces large clumps of particles into a sphere, like what would happen in reality. Roche limits are done completely implicitly and rely on purely physics (difference in gravity from one side of a planet to another). Downsides is that such an SPH implementation is really difficult to optimise and thus is incredibly slow. This implementation also does not scale up to larger scales well in terms of performance.


# To-Dos

# Default Controls (Newest Version)
W,S: Move forwards / backwards

A,D: Move sideways

Q,E: Move vertically relative to 'world'

I: Spawn Object of properites

Alpha 1: Reset velocities to zero

Alpha 2: Reset all temperatures to 300K

Alpha 3: Reset global momentum to zero.

Enter / Return: spawns a still particle near camera with material settings if specified.

Right Shift: Reset timestep and camera exposure

'/' : Remove all particles

'Backspace' : Remove laser light

';' and ('): Change laser power

'L' fire laser

space: pause

'Z': Toggle between Position Mode and Velocity Mode.

',' and '.': change timestep; high timesteps result in instability

scrollwheel: change camera speed

'[' and ']': changes simulation accuracy; how many interactions are actually calculated

'P': Change Material types.

'Esc': Settings Menu

'Home': Save Simulation, Saved in PhysicsSandbox1/PhysicsSandbox1Data/saves/savename.phys
