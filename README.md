# LudiPhys
A physics sandbox game made by LudicrousFun and inspired by Universe Sandbox 2
Game uses particles to simulate planets.

planets are a collection of particles bound together by gravity.

particles exert forces like gravity, collision, friction and 'pressure' forces.

particles have properties and thermodynamics.

# Main Controls
W,S: Move forwards / backwards

A,D: Move sideways

Q,E: Move vertically relative to 'world'

Alpha 0: Launch a particle at center of screen with a velocity pointing directly away from camera with speed of camera movement speed.

Alpha 1: Reset velocities to zero

Alpha 2: Reset all temperatures to 300K

Enter / Return: spawns a still particle near camera

space: pause


',' and '.': change timestep; high timesteps result in instability

scrollwheel: change camera speed

'[' and ']': changes simulation accuracy; how many interactions are actually calculated


# Changelog

28th Feb 2021: initial Conception, Just made a particle orbit the origin of the map

1st Mar: Added particle-particle interactions, created bugs and fixing them

... Missing entries ...

3rd Mar: Added thermodynamics (Conduction, shock heating, etc.) and others.

4th Mar: UI, Other settings.
