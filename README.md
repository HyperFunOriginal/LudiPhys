# LudiPhys
A physics sandbox game made by LudicrousFun and inspired by Universe Sandbox 2

Game uses particles to simulate planets.

planets are a collection of particles bound together by gravity.

particles exert forces like gravity, collision, friction and 'pressure' forces.

particles have properties and thermodynamics.

#To-Dos

- Keybind changing
- Keybind settings
- Radioactive materials
- Compute Shaders

# Main Controls (Newest Version)
W,S: Move forwards / backwards

A,D: Move sideways

Q,E: Move vertically relative to 'world'

Alpha 7: Launch a particle at center of screen with a velocity pointing directly away from camera with speed of camera movement speed. If specified, it will launch a specific material. If not, it'll launch silicate.

Alpha 8: Launch a ~180km radius asteroid, launches similarly to Alpha 7.

Alpha 9: Launch a ~400km radius dwarf planet, launches similarly to Alpha 7 but with no material options.

Alpha 1: Reset velocities to zero

Alpha 2: Reset all temperatures to 300K

Enter / Return: spawns a still particle near camera with material settings if specified.

Right Shift: Reset timestep and camera exposure

'/' : Remove all particles

'Backspace' : Remove laser light

';' and ('): Change laser power

'L' fire laser

space: pause

'Z': Toggle between Position Mode and Velocity Mode.

',' and '.': change timestep; high timesteps result in instability

scrollwheel: change camera speed

'[' and ']': changes simulation accuracy; how many interactions are actually calculated

'P': Change Material types.

'Esc': Settings Menu

'Home': Save Simulation, Saved in PhysicsSandbox1/PhysicsSandbox1Data/saves/savename.phys

'End': Load save

'O' : Hold down to spawn objects in orbit

'[' and ']': Controls camera exposure.
